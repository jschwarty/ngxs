# 2.0.0-rc.0
## Breaking
- `@Store()` decorator is now `@State()`
- `Ngxs` service is now `Store`
- Stores should be now renamed to State. Before: `ZooStore` should be `ZooState`
- `@Mutation` is gone in favor of just `@Action`
- Action's first argument is state context object, `{ state, setState }`
- You use `setState` to set the state now rather than returning it in actions
- Events are now just called Actions
- `ofEvent` is now called `ofAction`
- Plugins `next` fn now returns an observable
- Local Storage plugins removed Strategy in favor of passing your own engine

## Features
- Simplified APIs by removing Mutations, decreased boilerplate
- Added sub state capability
- Add `store.selectOnce()` shortcut function
- Better tpyings
- Add `dispatch` function in state context for easier dispatching

- `dispatch().subscribe()` now works correctly
- Promises now resolve correctly
